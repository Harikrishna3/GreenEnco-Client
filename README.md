The backend system serves as the core component of your application, responsible for handling data storage, retrieval, and processing. Its primary purpose is to support and enable the functionality of the entire application. It does so by providing a RESTful API that allows communication between the frontend and the data store.


## Management:
 The backend system acts as a bridge between the frontend and the database. It handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the application's data. This means it can create new records, retrieve existing ones, update data, and delete records when necessary.

## GET
https://greenenco-api.onrender.com/details

Gives all details of data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## GET
https://greenenco-api.onrender.com/details/:id

## Gives details of specified Id 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## POST
https://greenenco-api.onrender.com/details

To Create or Add Data in database

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PATCH
https://greenenco-api.onrender.com/details/:id

To make a update in specified ID

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DELETE
https://greenenco-api.onrender.com/details/:id

To delete data of specified ID

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
